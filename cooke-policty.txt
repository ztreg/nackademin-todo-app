Cookie Policy

* What is a cookie?


* What data is stored inside cookies?

The data is saved inside session storage in four different session items:
id, token, username and role.
We save that token string to display what user is signed in, what id you have and what role you have
The token is only saved as long as the session is active or if you destroy the token.


* Why is that data saved?

We save that token to confirm your account information to make sure
you are who you say you are and keep you signed in on the service until the token expires.
